          <h2>That Same Nashville Hot Taste Without The Chicken"</h2>
          <h3> Who knew what you could do with some cauliflower and some "HOT" spices. Enjoy this all vegan recipe </h3>

          <strong>INGREDIENTS </strong>
          <ul>
                <li> 1 head of cauliflower</li>
                <li>4 flax eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of almond milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of hot sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>4 cups vegetable oil(enough to halfway cover cauliflower in pot)</li>
                <li> cup of vegan butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon of the hot chicken rub</li>
                <li>4-8 slices of white sandwich bread</li>
                <li>pickle slices</li>
            
          </ul>
          <strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Chop up the head of cauliflower into bite sized pieces. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk together the flax eggs, almond milk, and hot sauce.
            </li>
            <li>In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together the flour, corn starch, baking powder, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>Heat your oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium high heat. To test that it’s ready, drop a bit of the batter (wet ingredients mixed with the dry ingredients) into the pot. Once it floats to the top, the oil is ready.</li>
            <li>Prepare a place for the fried cauliflower to rest after it comes out of the oil. I’ve found the best results by places a wire rack over top of a baking sheet and then placing a paper towel under the rack to collect some of the oil.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, dip the cauliflower pieces in the wet mixture, then dip each piece fully in the flour mixture. I do this TWO times per piece of cauliflower but you can also just do once.</li>
            <li>Gently place the cauliflower into the pot in a single layer. Fry for about 4-5 minutes on each side. It’s done when the breading just begins to brown. While one batch is frying, prepare the next batch.</li>
            <li>Place the finished pieces on the wire rack to cool down.
            </li>
            <li>Once all of the cauliflower is fried, prepare the spice mix by whisking together the spices and the melted butter in a small bowl. Place the cauliflower in a large bowl and drizzly the butter mixture over top. Toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Serve the Hot Cauliflower on the bread and topped with the pickle slices.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!! (and have a good drink nearby!!)</li>
